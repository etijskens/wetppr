# Evaluation

In this course you will be learning by doing. You will be given an [assignment](assignment.md), a (parallel) 
programming task on which you will work for several weeks, under my supervision and with my support. The code that 
you write must be regularly committed to a [GitHub](https://github) repository. This has many advantages:

- First, it serves as a backup. Every single commit can be retrieved at all times. So, you can't loose your code, 
  even not the older versions.
- Everyone with access to the repository can access the code. If you keep the repository public, that means everyone 
  with access to the internet. If you make it private, only the people you invite can access. 
- It is important that you give me access. If you have problems, I can clone your repository and debug it to see 
  what is going wrong,
- If you cooperate with another student on the project you can exchange updates easily. You can make use of git 
  branches to avoid bother other people with your code changes before they are correct.  

At our final session you will give a presentation about your work

- explaining the problems you encountered,
- explaining your approach,
- providing performance measurements for the different versions your code, and for different node counts,
- explaining the performance measurements,
- explaining what you found difficult during this course.

After the presentation I will ask some questions, mainly because I am curious and eager to learn something, but also 
to ensure that you understand what you present. 

The presentation must be added to your GitHub repository before you give your presentation. I will clone it and keep 
it as a proof of your results.
