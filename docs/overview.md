# Overview

## Goals of the course

- Parallel programming?
  - What? 
    - Distribute work over many CPUs
  - why?
    - Shorter time to solution
    - Bigger problems
    - higher accuracy
  - how?
    - tools: OpenMP, MPI
    - Principles and *best practices*
    - A strategy for scientific software development
      - Python + C++/Modern Fortran

## Performance aspects of modern CPU architecture and hierarchical memory
    
- A short introduction: 
  [Memory location matters for performance](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/performance-memory-locality/)
- A very good talk about this topic, you need to see this:
