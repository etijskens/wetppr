## Background knowledge

- The working of a modern processor
  - CPU architecture and hierarchical memory architecture
    - A short introduction: [Memory location matters for performance](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/performance-memory-locality/)
    - A very good talk about this topic, you need to see this: [Scott Meyers on *Cpu Caches and Why You Care*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE) 
  - Accelerators (GPU), increasingly important topic, but we cannot treat everything in this course. 
- The architecture of a supercomputer
  - Nodes and cores, NUMA domains
  - Interconnect
