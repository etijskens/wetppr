#### Education

Lic. Aard- en delfstofkunde (_Master in Geology_), _Master in Physics of Microelectronics and Material Sciences_, Doctor in de Natuurwetenschappen (_PhD in Science_). None of these included a formal course in programming, nor computational science... I learned by continuously searching for better ways to accomplish the computational tasks I was facing.

#### Work

Since 2012 I am employed at **[CalcUA](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-facilities/calcua/)**, the University of Antwerp's core facility for supercomputing, and for the [VSC](https://vscentrum.be) (**Vlaams Supercomputer Centrum**), providing support and education to researchers on topics as scientific programming, high performance computing, code modernization, performance analysis. I am passionate about  **Python**, **C++**, **Fortran** and libraries and frameworks for building performant parallel applications.

#### Teaching

Since 2014 I teach "Parallel programmeren - 2000WETPPR" at the Science Faculty of the University of Antwerp. I enjoy teaching and sharing +30 years of experience in scientific programming for HPC environments.

#### Discrete Element Modelling
Before 2012 I was leading the **DEM Research Group** At KU Leuven. DEM stands for ***Discrete Element Modelling***. It is comparable to ***Molecular Dynamics***, but then in the macroscopic world with the atoms replaced by 3D grains with an arbitrary shape. It is also referred to as ***Granular Dynamics*** genoemd. Granular flow occur abundantly in many natural and industrial processes and its modelling is interesting to understand their behavior, and optimize industrial process installations. The computations are challenging because the physics of granular flows is complex. Contrary to Molecular Dynamics, interactions between grains are dissipative and contact forces are determined by material and surface properties, and, because of the 3D shape of the grains also have a tangential component (friction). Furthermore, grains can be deformable and break up into smaller grains. Because granular processes often involve large numbers of particles, performance and parallellisation of modelling software is essential. The simulation software developed at the DEM Research Group is currently commercialized by **[Mpacts](https://mpacts.com)**.

##### CNH combine harvesteer - designed with Mpacts software

The combine harvester exhibits several granular processes:

- the straw is cut and drawn into the machine,

- threshing (detach the grains from the straw),

- separating straw and grains,

- blowing away the chaff,

- transporting the grains to the tank,

- emptying the tank and transport to the trailer behind the tractor

Because interactions are dissipative, the motion of the particles fades.
