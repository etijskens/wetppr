### Installing packages
- [A quick-and-dirty guide on how to install packages for Python](https://snarky.ca/a-quick-and-dirty-guide-on-how-to-install-packages-for-python/)
- [uv - pip killer or yet another package manager?](https://blog.kusho.ai/uv-pip-killer-or-yet-another-package-manager/): uv is the "pip but blazingly fast™️ because it's written in rust" and is developed by the same folks that built ruff. It is designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools for package management. uv supports everything you'd expect from a modern Python packaging tool: editable installs, Git dependencies, URL dependencies, local dependencies, constraint files, source distributions, custom indexes, and more, all designed around drop-in compatibility with your existing tools. uv's virtual environments are standards-compliant and work interchangeably with other tools — there's no lock-in or customization required. It supports Linux, Windows, and macOS, and has been tested at-scale against the public PyPI index.

### Parallelization approaches mimicking or wrapping OpenMP and MPI:
- [Pymp – OpenMP-like Python Programming](https://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Pymp-OpenMP-like-Python-Programming?utm_source=ADMIN+Newsletter&utm_campaign=HPC_Update_135_2020-04-16_Pymp_–_OpenMP-like_Python_Programming) A really interesting concept, not as efficient as OpenMP itself (which incurs quite a bit of overhead itself), and, of course, limited to a single node. As the number of cores per node keeps increasing, pymp may be a good solution for problems that can do with a single node.

### Figures

- [Penrose](https://github.com/penrose/penrose): create beautiful diagrams just by typing notation in plain text

### Mkdocs and Markdown

[This tutorial by Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/) really got me going in an afternoon... The extension with autorefs is also very useful. Note that the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` makes publication on readthedocs superfluous! 

#### Installation
We need the following packages to build documentation:

    > python -m pip install mkdocs
    > python -m pip install "mkdocstrings[python]"
    > python -m pip install mkdocs-material
    > python -m pip install mkdocs-autorefs 

#### Markdown FAQ

1. For ~~all~~ most of your formatting questions: [The Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org)
2. How to do [comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4823468/comments-in-markdown)
3. Tune Your Configuration: Explore [advanced configuration for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/creating-your-site/#advanced-configuration), such as adding support for search and multiple languages. Or install and include additional plugins. A good option is [autorefs](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/autorefs/), which allows you to add relative links in your docstrings that work in your rendered documentation.  
4. [LateX in markdown](https://www.fabriziomusacchio.com/blog/2021-08-10-How_to_use_LaTeX_in_Markdown/)
5. [Converting reStucturedText to Markdown]()

#### Other Markdown applications

- a Markdown viewer/browser for your terminal: https://github.com/Textualize/frogmouth
- Markdown Code Runner: https://github.com/basnijholt/markdown-code-runner
 
### Sphinx and ReST
(imho less practical than `mkdocs`)
