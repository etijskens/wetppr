# QUOTES

"The code you write makes you a programmer. The code you delete makes you a good one. The code you don't have to write makes you a great one." - Mario Fusco

“It's hard enough to find an error in your code when you're looking for it; it's even harder when you've assumed your code is error-free.” - Steve McConnell

"the most dangerous thought you can have as a creative person, is that
you know what you are doing." [Bret Victor - The Future of
Programming](https://vimeo.com/71278954).

"Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were
unqualified to solve until they actually did it." - Patrick McKenzie

It´s better to wait for a productive programmer to become available than
it is to wait for the first available programmer to become productive. -
Steve McConnell

Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first
place.Therfore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are,
by definition, not smart enough to debug it. - Rajanand

Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaning your code will be a
violent psychopath who knows where you live. - Rick Osborne

The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a
programmer is doing until it's too late. - Seymour Cray

First, solve the problem. Then write the code. - John Johnson

Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad. – Cory House

Simplicity is the soul of efficiency. – Austin Freeman

Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are
three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.

C makes it easy to shoot yourself in the foot; C++ makes it harder, but
when you do, it blows your whole leg off.

A system administrator has two problems: 1. Dumb users. 2. Smart users.

"Never trust a programmer in a suit." - Anonymous

"Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it.
Geniuses remove it." - Alan J. Perlis

"Theory and practice sometimes clash. And when that happens, theory
loses. Every single time." - Linus Torvalds

"Code never lies, comments sometimes do." - Ron Jeffries

# Python for HPC

Here's a list of approaches that rely on low-level programming
languages, as C, C++ and Fortran, for speeding up Python (sequential)
code. Some of these approaches, e.g. [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org)
rely on automatic code transformation from Python, so there is no need
to write low-level code yourself.

## Approaches mimicking or wrapping OpenMP and MPI:

-   [Pymp – OpenMP-like Python  Programming](https://www.admin-magazine.com/HPC/Articles/Pymp-OpenMP-like-Python-Programming?utm_source=ADMIN+Newsletter&utm_campaign=HPC_Update_135_2020-04-16_Pymp_–_OpenMP-like_Python_Programming)  A really interesting concept, not as efficient as OpenMP itself  (which incurs quite a bit of overhead itself), and, of course,  limited to a single node. As the number of cores per node keeps  increasing, pymp may be a good solution for problems that can do  with a single node.
